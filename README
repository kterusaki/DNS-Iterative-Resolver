DNS Iterative Resolver
This program maps host names to IP addresses. It queries a server for a host name to IP address
mappings (Type A) unless given the -m flag, in which it queries for mail exchanges (Type MX).
It prints out the intermediate steps as it traverses the DNS hierarchy. If asked to resolve an
invalid name it prints an error. If the program encounters Type CNAME, then it prints out CNAME 
and exits.

Inputs: 1) hostname 
        2) root-servers.txt
